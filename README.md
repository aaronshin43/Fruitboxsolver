# Fruitbox Solver
Fruitbox is a web-based puzzle game where you drag the screen with your mouse to surround the apples with a number between 1-9 so that the sum of the numbers is 10.
## Purpose
I aim to create a program that can provide me the way to get highest point when given a random arrangement of apples.<br/>
